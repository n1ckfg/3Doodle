===================================
Some of our code borrows codes from other amazing works.
For example,
diffVG for differentiable rasterizer (https://github.com/BachiLi/diffvg)
clip pretrained weight and clip loss from CLIPasso, and we also borrow codes from nerf-pytorch repo for volume rendering (https://www.google.com/search?q=nerf-pytorch&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
So one would need to check their license if you want to use our code.
